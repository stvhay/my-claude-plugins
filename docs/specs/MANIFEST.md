# Subsystem Specifications

> This manifest indexes all SPEC.md files in the project. Updated by the
> `/codify-subsystem` skill. Agents use this to discover specs for subsystems
> outside their immediate working directory.

## Cold-Tier Retrieval

This manifest serves as the cold-tier baseline for the three-tier context
architecture. Agents consult it when they need specs outside their immediate
working directory (warm tier) or the always-loaded CLAUDE.md (hot tier).

For projects with many subsystems, pair this manifest with
[local-rag](https://github.com/aihaysteve/local-rag) to enable semantic
retrieval over SPEC.md files. local-rag indexes Markdown documents and
provides an MCP retrieval service that agents can query by task description
rather than navigating the manifest manually.
