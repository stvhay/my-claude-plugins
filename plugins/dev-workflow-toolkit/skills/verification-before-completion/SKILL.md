# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim? Check CONTRIBUTING.md for a project-specific quality gate command before guessing.
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. PREFLIGHT: If `bd preflight` is available, run `bd preflight --check` for pre-PR readiness
   - Reviews tests, lint, formatting, and project-specific checks (varies by project)
   - Address any failing checks before claiming completion; skipped checks are informational
6. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
❌ "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**
```
✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
❌ "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**
```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
❌ Trust agent report
```

## Why This Matters

From 24 failure memories:
- your human partner said "I don't believe you" - trust broken
- Undefined functions shipped - would crash
- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features
- Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework
- Violates: "Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced."

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:**
- ANY variation of success/completion claims
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- ANY positive statement about work state
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task
- Delegating to agents

**Rule applies to:**
- Exact phrases
- Paraphrases and synonyms
- Implications of success
- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness

## The Bottom Line

**No shortcuts for verification.**

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is non-negotiable.

## Work Tracking

Follow the work-tracking protocol in SPEC.md (INV-14). Skill-specific additions:

- Log verification results: `bd update <task-id> --notes "Review: PASS — verification ✅, quality gate ✅"`

## Integration with Code Simplification

After verification passes, invoke the code-simplification skill:

```
verify (this skill) → invoke /code-simplification → re-verify → complete
```

**Explicitly invoke** `/code-simplification` after step 6 passes. The simplification skill will:
- Apply low-risk changes automatically
- Flag structural changes for approval
- Analyze failures for deeper issues
- Re-run verification after changes

Only after simplification completes and final verification passes can completion be claimed.

## SPEC.md Invariant Check

After standard verification passes, check for subsystem specifications:

1. **Find SPEC.md** — Walk up from modified files to find the nearest SPEC.md
2. **If found, check invariants** — Review each invariant in the spec's table.
   For each one, verify it still holds after your changes. How to verify
   depends on the invariant type:
   - **Testable invariants** (data constraints, API contracts): run the
     corresponding `test_invN_*` test. A passing test is sufficient evidence.
   - **Architectural invariants** (coupling rules, file organization, naming):
     review the diff against the constraint. Confirm the change doesn't
     introduce a violation.
   - **Unclear or untestable invariants**: note them in the report rather
     than skipping — flag for human review.
3. **Check coverage** — Grep the subsystem's test files for `# Tests INV-N`
   and `# Tests FAIL-N` inline comments. Verify that every INV-N and FAIL-N
   in the spec has at least one corresponding test with an inline comment,
   and that the test passes. Flag uncovered spec items.
4. **Report** — Include invariant and coverage check results in verification output

This is a lightweight consistency check, not a replacement for the full test
suite. If an invariant is unclear or untestable, note it rather than skipping it.

### Staleness Check

After checking invariants, assess whether the SPEC.md is still current:

1. **Compare modification dates** — If source files in the subsystem have been
   modified more recently than SPEC.md (check via `git log -1 --format=%ci`),
   the spec may be stale.
2. **Check for drift** — Do your changes introduce new invariants, failure modes,
   or public interfaces not captured in the spec? If yes, flag for update.
3. **Report staleness** — Include in verification output. Recommend
   `/codify-subsystem` to refresh the spec if significant drift is detected.

A stale spec is better than no spec — don't block completion on staleness alone.
Flag it and move on.

> **Intentional redundancy:** This quality gate check may also run during
> finishing-a-development-branch. Running it in both places is intentional —
> this skill validates current state, finishing validates branch readiness.

### Quality Gate Check

After SPEC.md invariant checks pass, run the structural quality gate:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/quality-gate.sh --path "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
```

The script checks its own dependencies (uv, Python) and gives clear error
messages if anything is missing.

If the quality gate reports failures, include them in the verification output.
Failures in `inv-numbering`, `skill-structure`, and `doc-structure` must block
completion. Failures in `tool-health` and `issue-tracking` are warnings only.

```
SPEC.md invariant check:
- [path/to/SPEC.md]
- INV-1: [description] → ✅ Still holds / ❌ Violated
- FAIL-1: [description] → ✅ Handled / ❌ Unhandled

Coverage check (grep for `# Tests INV-N` in test files):
- INV-1 → [test_file:line] ✅ Covered / ❌ Missing inline comment
- FAIL-1 → [test_file:line] ✅ Covered / ❌ Missing inline comment

Staleness:
- SPEC.md last modified: [date]
- Source files modified after spec: [yes/no — list files if yes]
- New invariants/interfaces not in spec: [yes/no — describe if yes]
- Recommendation: [Current / Recommend re-codification]
```

### Review Documentation

After verification and quality gate pass, document the review:

- **Beads:** `bd update <task-id> --notes "Review: PASS — verification ✅, quality gate ✅"`
- **GitHub issue:** Post a summary:
  ```bash
  gh issue comment <N> --body "$(cat <<'REVIEW_EOF'
  ## Verification Review
  <details><summary>Verdict: PASS — all checks green</summary>

  - Tests: N/N passing
  - Quality gate: PASS
  - SPEC.md invariants: all hold
  </details>
  REVIEW_EOF
  )"
  ```

If either `bd` or `gh` is unavailable, use whichever is available. Proceed without documentation if neither is available.
