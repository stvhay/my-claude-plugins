# dev-workflow-toolkit

Development workflow skills for Claude Code. Replaces [claude-gh-project-template](https://github.com/stvhay/claude-gh-project-template) as a distributable plugin.

## Installation

```
/plugin marketplace add stvhay/my-claude-plugins
```

Select `dev-workflow-toolkit` from the plugin list.

**Prerequisites:** [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for quality gate checks). Install: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

**Recommended companion:** Install `writing-toolkit` for the `writing-clearly-and-concisely` skill referenced by several workflow skills.

| `codify-subsystem` | Encode subsystem knowledge as SPEC.md |
| `retrospective` | Post-completion session analysis and upstream feedback |

## Skill Dependencies

Skills invoke other skills to create workflow orchestration. This prevents circular invocations:

```
brainstorming (entry)
  └─> using-git-worktrees (pre-flight, if on main)
  └─> documentation-standards (draft mode, after design approval)
  └─> ux-design-agent* (optional, for user-facing/agentic designs)
  └─> writing-plans (terminal state)
       └─> executing-plans OR subagent-driven-development
            └─> test-driven-development (during implementation)
            └─> systematic-debugging (when bugs occur)
            └─> verification-before-completion (before completion)
                 └─> quality-gate.sh (structural checks)
                 └─> code-simplification (after verification passes)
            └─> finishing-a-development-branch (after implementation)
                 └─> documentation-standards (validate mode, hard gate)
                 └─> quality-gate.sh (structural checks)
                 └─> retrospective (after PR, non-blocking)

requesting-code-review (parallel workflow)
  └─> code-reviewer agent (separate invocation)

codify-subsystem (standalone)
project-init (standalone)
setup-rag (standalone)
dispatching-parallel-agents (standalone)
```

**\* External dependency:** ux-design-agent is in the ux-toolkit plugin

**Terminal states:** Skills that don't invoke others: `receiving-code-review`, `code-simplification`, `retrospective`

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd plugins/dev-workflow-toolkit
./tests/run-all.sh
```

**79 tests**[^stat-test-count] across 3 modules[^stat-suite-count]:
- Structure — frontmatter validation, SPEC.md checks, project-init templates, setup-rag config
- Integration — skill loading, dependency resolution, trigger patterns, reference files
- Quality gate — smoke tests, negative fixtures, doc-stats validation

See `tests/README.md` for details.

## Documentation

- `docs/architecture/` — Design rationale and foundations
- `docs/FIRST_RUN.md` — Project memory initialization
- `scripts/quality-gate.sh` — Structural validation (requires uv)
